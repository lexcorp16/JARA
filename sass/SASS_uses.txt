Why use SASS?

* Increased efficiency through the use of partials and imports as well as the use of variables.

* Improves code reusability by means of mixins and inheritance thereby making the code as DRY as possible.

* Improved modularity by means of nesting.

* Sass will not only let you scale styles when working on big web development projects, it will also make it much faster and efficient to write reusable styles from scratch for smaller projects.


Writing SASS feels a lot like how one would write code in an actual programming language and this I think is a very neat feature.
