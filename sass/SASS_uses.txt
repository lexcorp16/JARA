Why use SASS?

* Increased efficiency through the use of partials and imports as well as the use of variables.

* Improves code reusability by means of mixins and inheritance thereby making the code as DRY as possible.

* Improved modularity by means of nesting.


Writing SASS feels a lot like how one would write code in an actual programming language and this I think is a very neat feature.
