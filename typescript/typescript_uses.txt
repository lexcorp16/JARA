TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript which primarily provides optional static typing and compile time type checking, classical object-oriented programming patterns and interfaces.
 
Why use Typescript?

* Removes the need for a lot of type checks by its inbuilt type enforcing mechanisms and this could effectively increase speed.
If the codebase is large and has a number of developers working on it, it would make sense to use typescript as its transpiler(compiler that converts code written in one language into another language that has a similar level of abstraction) reaveals a number of obvious mistakes.

* Since Typescript is a superset of Javascript, it can easily integrate the great features of ES6 and any other version of Javascript that is to come.

In the end, Typecript is just Javascript with a number of additional feature so learning and writing Typescript will be easy for Javascript developers.
